Problem Statement

########################

Data scientists have managed to identify 371 of the ghastly creatures, but need our help to vanquish the rest. And only an accurate classification algorithm can thwart them. Use bone length measurements, severity of rot, extent of soullessness, and other characteristics to distinguish (and extinguish) the intruders.

Languages and models used

###############################

Python, numpy, pandas, sklearn, random forests, SVM
